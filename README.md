# DDPG in TensorFlow 2.0

This repository implements the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm using the TensorFlow 2.0 API. DDPG was first proposed by [Lillicrap et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) and this implementation is partly adapted from [Spinning Up](https://github.com/openai/spinningup/).

## Requirements

See `environment.yml`.

## Demo

Run `test.py`.
